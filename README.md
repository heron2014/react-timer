React timer and countdown





#### Set up tests:
- explanation [here](https://github.com/heron2014/react-timer/issues/1)

- Notes:
  ```react-addons-test-utils``` should be the same version as ```react``` (this module is used for testing)

- test if the function is called or not ([spy](https://github.com/mjackson/expect#spy-tohavebeencalled))
